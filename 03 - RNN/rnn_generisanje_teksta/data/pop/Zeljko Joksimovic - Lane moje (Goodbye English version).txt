Your name is on my lips
the night is tender, full of memories
it's all I have now
and for the last time
I feel and hold you in my arms

Ref.
Say goodbye and I'm leaving
I can't stay another day
I can share another feeling
love will tear us anyway

Say goodbye and I'm leaving
save your tears and don't you cry
all I take with me is grieving
in the name of love goodbye
