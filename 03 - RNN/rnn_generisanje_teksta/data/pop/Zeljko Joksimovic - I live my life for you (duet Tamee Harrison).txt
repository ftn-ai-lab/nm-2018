Far, far away from you
I'm drowning in the memories
the sense of your sweet parfume
is all I have to make
me feel you are here

No, I never really meant to say
those nasty things I said
I feel so lost without you
by my side

Ref.
You can make a song
and I will sing it
make a wish and I'll fulfill it
can't you see it's true
I live my life for you
if you want a star
then I will catch it
take my broken heart and mend it
yes, my love it's true
I live my life for you

I've been crying rivers
through the night
feeling all alone without you here
why, did it have to be this way
only you can take this pain away
