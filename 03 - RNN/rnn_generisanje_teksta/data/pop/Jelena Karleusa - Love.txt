I need your love around me every day
no matter what I do or what I say every day
I need your love to keep me safe at night
you're my heart's desire my delight

Ref.
Love, I'm in love with you
this is a dream come true
you want this too
my heart belongs to you
this is a dream come true
you want this too
my heart belongs to you

As long as we're alive
this true love can survive
can survive

I know that your forever in my heart
you know I felt this way
right from the start in my heart
I see the world with love when you are near
I see your face and everything is clear

Ref.

As long as we're alive
this true love can survive
can survive

Let me love you forever
let me into your heart
we can reach the stars above
I can promise you heaven
in the palm of your hand
we can make it 'till the end
precious love

This is a dream come true
you want this too
my heart belongs to you
